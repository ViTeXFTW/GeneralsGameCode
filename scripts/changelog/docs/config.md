# Changelog Configuration

## Table of Contents


### Configuration File
The configuration file is used to define the desired output format and structure of the changelog. It allows customization of what information is included in the changelog, such as labels, sections, and formatting options. It also supports groups of changes to be displayed together based on either labels or keywords in the change title.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If a change has multiple labels, grouping will be done based on highest label level. see [Label Usage](user_guide.md#label-usage) for more details.
